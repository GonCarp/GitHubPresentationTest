18/03/2019
- Added Motofil Rofin, Andatex, and Pallet6 (hydro+1_servo).

01/03/2019
- Added Nlight and ETS-C200

12/11/2018
- Added in LsrOn.cfs the management of "%LsPlc26.8", this bit confirm that for plc %TstP15 
  is at 0. In this way is sure the next actions on%TstP15 can be executed properly.

03/11/2018 v4.2.8 + Pipe v2.3
- Update firmware version 34.10, included friction compensation
- Added the second spindle management and alignement routine
- Added Highyag cycles for 20mm.


25/10/2018 V4.2.7 + P2.2
- -3292.cfs bug fixed about "roundFlag" bit,it was always at 0 also if the pipe was 
  rounded, added the conditions to identify the correct profile in case the pipe is along Y.
- Spindle calibration now is always performed to ensure the center of the spindle and the center
  of the pipe with respect to the spindle are compensated.
- Added auto origin acquire for pipe.


13-21/10/2018 V4.2.6 + P2.2
- Added in user.plc safeties about jog movements,in case the operator moves
 wrongly the head in pipe side;
- Added "SafetyPipeOrig.cfs" and "SafePipeAxPos.cfs"; these two routines
 check if the origin is setted correctly with respect to the position of the head in
 that moment and with respect the position of the origin in that moment.
- Bug fixed on "go to origin" button in "ManualApa" tab.
- Added two errors about the capacitive sensore in "LsrTouch.cfs", in laser touch
 now before execute the approch to the surface, there is a control on the value of capacitive sensor (mm)
 if it is less than 8mm the cycle will give alarm and not move the Z axis; same way if the 
 "LsrTouch.cfs" receive a setpoint less than 0.3mm.
- Added calibraton on pipe if origin 19 is selected
- Added "AutoAquire origin" for pipe, only if origin 19 is selected
- Removed in "OverStoreSUB0.cfu" G153 G0 Z(trave_safe_z)
- In G800 if condition , otherwise Z axis can wrong the offset of the position (added G180 P1 X(tr_x) Y(tr_y) Z(tr_z) C(VA2))
- Graph_set_orig.cfs added the offset in case of pipe cutting in the origin parameters
- CalPipe.plc and pages bug fixed, conflict on bit %CalPipe.General.3 and added button to reset 
  the calibration parameters in case of wrong calibration(due to the wrong pipe installation).


13/10/2018 V4.2.5 + P2.1
- Modified -1800.cfs,Sel_Y3Z?cfs, cfpstart.cfp in order to have different
 safeties level for pipe and plane machine
- In main.plc added set alarm of axes 27,28,29,30 in case of some alarm comes from 
  channel 0 or channel3. It avoid Z axis crash.
- Added option in piercing page, save gas in function of distance, these changes are in -1800.cfs (L5) 
  and -1153.cfs (in case of L0)
- Found a conflict between two functions, return after pause and z up after pause, 
  it has been fixed in fastR.plc by adding a condition on the automatic retrace command.

10/10/2018 V4.2.4 + Pipe V2.0
- Update -1806.cfs,plasma inc.cfs,getorix.cfs,getoriy.cfs,
  main.plc,resmach.plc,restarT.plc to manage the two pallet level inside the machine.
  In setlaser page there are two new option(enable two pallet level, offset second pallet)


9/10/2018 V4.2.3 + Pipe V2.0
- Gas system update, new gas.plc and added gasprop.plc.
  Purging and gas management changed


10-12/09/2018 V4.2.2 + Pipe V2.0
--------------------------------
- RegLsr.plc: Changed some part of jumping management. Now the distance from target where
              must be enable the regulation and the K factor (gain) of jumping, is calculated
              in base of the jumping space.
              There are 3 zone, each of these zone have 2 parameters, Distance to enable the
              regulation, and the gain of jump. 
- Reg_check2.str: is a new page where you can find the parameters of jumping
- NuovoSinottico.str: Only when it is selected the PROGRAM management, it is always visible
                      the program counter.
- Sheet control: Insert a LSRCostk56 that indicate the absolute quote of Z axis before X/Y 
                 axes moving for sheet control
- External pallet management: after return from safety position, the CNC goes in JOG mode.
- Retrace function: now it is possible to move axes in retrace mode with [X+] and [X-] button on
                    the remote controller.
- STOP on remote control: now it works both to stop axes (hold) and in the return after pause management.
- Return after pause: during back movement the gases are closed
- Upgraded "UI menu fissi" to this version: 7_2_10_2. Inserted %ui39.1. This is setted when the CNC start
  the reset procedure. It is used to put in emergency the CNC before CNC reset.



15-31/08/2018 V4.2.1 + Pipe V2.0
- LsrOn.cfs added M1210 in cut section, this because if the piercing is only outside the range
  of capacitive sensor, regulation remains disabled.
- Introduced in LsrTouch.cfs SYN AWAIT(%C122.0), because the M-function were not 
  safe in pause condition.
- Capacit.plc this file has been change to complete the nozzle brushing function.


03/08/2018 V4.2.0 + Pipe V2.0
- APA.CFS added JSR "graph_set_kine.cfs" to update angle in graph

- Capacitive sensor supports variable range (at this moment insert 10,20);
  modified -1800.cfs, LsrTouch.cfs, reglsr.plc, capacit.plc.
  Calibration check page automatically shows the graph in funtion of the range
  Added in SetLaser.str the parameter capacitive sensor range.
- FastR.plc added other 5 linearization points for linearization. Linearization 
  is in function of the range of the sensor, not fixed. 

  Simulation: added in FastS.plc a simulation of an capacitive parabolic input,
  this works with analog signal simultated with an external encoder. Added 
  the tip touch signal simulated in function of the thickness; now is possible 
  to test all capacitive sensor calibration and "calibration control" procedure.

- Added calibration cycles pages 
- Firmware Update Version 34.8 Jiten, in this update there are two parameters 
  "Filter changes smoothing time costant 1 and 2" to allow a 
  smooth changing between two different values of damping filter.

  During pipe cutting, is used dynamic syswide function beetween 
  Y and W if gantry is along Y or X and W if gantry is along X.

- In this version focal axis (ax9) is on ch0 and not on ch3)
  this because W Ch3 is used for pipe cutting)

- Added two parameters for jump, one is the maximum height for plane
  machine, the other is for pipe.
